Absolutely. No prior AI knowledge is required to start IOAI. Curiosity and a willingness to learn are what matter most. Early rounds focus on general problem-solving and fundamentals. If you qualify for Round 4, Harbour.Space coaches and faculty will teach you the AI-specific content you need step by step.
