  {
    question: "How are the classes structured?",
    answer: "The classes for the camp are structured into four levels: zero, beginners, intermediate and advanced. The beginner level is designed for kids who have little to no experience with coding and computer technology. The intermediate level is for kids who have some prior experience and want to further their skills. The advanced level is for kids who have a strong foundation in coding and want to challenge themselves and take their skills to the next level. This structure ensures that kids of all skill levels can participate and receive a tailored learning experience that meets their needs. Kids will be grouped as 10-12, 13-14, 15-16 & 17-18 years in each level."

  {
    question: "How will kids be placed according to the different levels?",
    answer: "To ensure personalised learning, it's important to divide kids between the different levels of zero, beginner, intermediate and advanced, based on their current knowledge and skills in coding and computer technology. Our approach is to conduct pre-assessment tests or allow the kids to assess their own level and place themselves in the most appropriate group. It's also important to have flexible arrangements in place to allow for kids to move between levels if necessary, to ensure they are always challenged and engaged in their learning."

  {
    question: "What will kids learn in the beginner level?",
    answer: "In the beginner level of our kids' summer camp, participants will learn the basics of coding and computer technology. This will include an introduction to the fundamentals of programming concepts and logic, as well as hands-on experience building simple projects. By the end of the beginner level, students will have a solid understanding of the basics and be ready to move on to the next level. The goal of this level is to provide a foundation of knowledge that will set the students up for success in future coding endeavors."

    question: "What will kids learn in the Web (Intermediate) level?",
    answer: "At the intermediate level, the Web Wizadry, kids will build upon the foundation established in the beginner level and dive into more complex coding and computer technology concepts. They will work on a web development project where they will learn how to create and design a dynamic website from scratch. They will be introduced to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and will learn how to use these technologies to bring their website to life. Additionally, they will learn about website architecture and design, user experience, and the process of building and deploying a web application. By the end of the intermediate level, kids will have a deeper understanding of web development and the skills to bring their own ideas to life on the web."

  {
    question: "What will kids learn in the Master (advanced) level?",
    answer: "In the advanced level, the master, kids will dive into even more complex topics in computer technology and coding. They will learn about algorithms, which are a set of instructions used to perform specific tasks by a computer or machine. This level is designed for kids who have a good understanding of coding and are ready to take their skills to the next level. During the camp, kids will learn how to create, analyze and implement algorithms, which will enhance their problem-solving skills and equip them with the tools to tackle complex coding challenges. By the end of this level, kids will have a deep understanding of algorithms and how they can be used to create innovative and efficient solutions to real-world problems."
